	Do you know as a boy, Jay was called Dull Stupid. But his mother Yeh Huimei, noticed that the quiet , shy boy seemed to dance practically when he heart the Western Pop music she used to play. His mother sent him to a piano school when he was four. When he grew up, he developed an ability for instant playing beyond his years. I learned to play the piano from 7 years old to 13 years old. I often feel bored when I preactive playing the piano. But Jay was always crazy about playing the piano. I think he really like music. So I admire him very much, and I call him "Hero".
	
	I admire Jay. The real reason is when the others all denied him, he never gave up. He tried his best to change his life. I think it is good for everybody. I hope that everyone can learn from him.
	
	Try their best to do everything. Then I think we will make the grade.

	In China, students have to study all the time, they need to take all kinds of important exams, their parents want their kids take the first place, so students bury their heads in the books. When talking about Chinese kids and foreign kids, it has been admitted that Chinese kids are good at exams, while foreign kid are good at hand work. I think hand work is more important than the exam, students need to do some work to make themselves living. Chinese students need to join more activities, it can not only help them broaden their vision, but also can improve their overall quality. Besides getting high score, students also need to learn to do some hand work, or they will become bookworms. Parents should not care so much about the exams, they should give the children more freedom, exam is not everything.

	It has been estimated that smokers have made up helf of the population in China. And the smokers are becoming younger and younger, even including some middle school students.
	
	Nowadays more and more people have realized smoking can do harm to people's health. However, some people still enjoy smoking. Why? Because some of them think it is a kind of fashion, some think it is great fun and others, think that smoking can refresh themselves.
	
	In fact, smoking is a bad habit. It can cause a lot of diseases. Meanwhile smoking is a waste of money. Besides, careless smokers may cause dangerous fire.
	
	Smoking is harmful and it is not only bad for smokers themselves, but also bad for non-smokers.
	
	Therefore, I hope all the smokers can give up smoking for themselves and also for the people around them.

	Since I was small, I was so curious about the beach, because in my home, I never have the chance to see the real beach. It happens to me that my friends planned to go to Beihai this weekend, so I was so excited to join them. It took us four hours to arrive in Beihai, I saw the beach when I was in the busy, the water was so clean and there were so many people walked in the beach.

	Never shall I forget the first English lesson given by Miss Liu. On that day, when she entered the classroom, we found that she was a young and beautiful lady with a big smile on her face. THen she introduced herself saying that we should call her Miss Liu instead of Teacher Liu, a moment later, she let all of us go to the blackboard ad say something about ourselves in English in turn. When it was my turn, I felt so shy and fearful that I didn't dare to say a word before the class. She came up to me and said kindly, Don't be afraid. I believe you can do it. Come and have a try.
	
	My face turned red when I heard that. At last, I went to the blackboard and was able to do it quite well. She praised for what I had done. Up to now, I can still remember herwords in the first English lesson: Practice makes perfect. DOn't lose your courage when you meet with difficulties. Try on and on until you succed.

	For the old generation, they believe that thrift is a virtue and have been educating their offspring to keep these words all the time. Indded, thrift can help people not to waste the resources and let more people have the chance to share it. But sometimes over thrift is not favored by the young generation. Take my parents for example. They have gone through the hard time, so they save every cent they can. When we go shopping, my mother always hesitates to buy more food, because she wants to taste different flavor, but she is very struggling to pay the bill. Im my opinion, money is used to improve people's life, besides the basis needs, we also need to find amusement. The old generation only chases the former while ignore the latter. Money deserves to be spent on finding amusement. 
```

```
	Taking care of the old people is the traditional merit in China, because Chinese people pay special attention to the family union. As more and more young people choose to work in the big cities, they are far away from home and have less time to visit their parent. So they give them the money to show care of the old. But for the old people, they don't care much about the money, what they want is to see their children as often as possible. No matter how busy we are, we should spare some time to stay with our relatives. When they are gone, we will surely regret for not companying them with enough time. So don't let work stuffs take up your privatetime, just go home often and talk to your parents, which is worthy of all

No only because I love music, but also I love this world and I want to use my own way to express my feeling.

	On May 25, 2024, I was finally able to download an open-world game called "Wuthering Waves." When I first played the game, I found that it couldn't run in fullscreen mode without becoming very laggy. I think this is one of the game's shortcomings, and I know many players have complained to customer service about it. Of course, this game has many merits as well. Here is a look at the pros and cons of this game.

Talking about the game's advantages, there are many. For example, you can capture monsters like in Pokémon. I think this is one of the game's biggest advantages because this kind of gameplay can attract many players. Additionally, the game offers a lot of freedom. There are many tasks to choose from and many beautiful or handsome characters. The game world is very large, but I find the story a bit boring, although that is just my personal opinion.

The game download size is between 18GB and 20GB. As I mentioned earlier, one of the game's shortcomings is that it is very laggy. Maybe a lot of players quit because of this. The game is similar to another game, "Genshin Impact," and I found that it copies a lot of gameplay elements from other games, but that's okay with me. What really bothers me is why the game is so laggy, which frustrates me a little.

In conclusion, this game has both advantages and shortcomings, but I will continue to play it. I hope the game development team can optimize it in the future.

Recently, I have changed a lot because I realized that people cannot be too kind. If you are too kind, others will bully you and think you are easy to bully. For example, I used to be very kind, but when I was 12 years old, my relative came to my school and scolded me for allegedly hitting her daughter. I looked at her blankly because I didn't know what was going on. Why did she come to my school to scold me? I didn't hit her daughter or any girl. Even now, I still remember this incident and I am sure I didn't hit anyone.

Another example is when I was playing basketball with my brother and friends. The basketball accidentally hit another relative's car. However, that relative only scolded me. I don't understand why she scolded me since it wasn't my fault. Was it because I was the youngest there? Did she just take out her anger on me?

Another example is from my high school. Teachers always said that if someone bullies you, you should tell a teacher and they will help you. Once, I was bullied by some Malay students at school. I wasn't scared because I reported it to the teacher. The teacher then called me and the students who bullied me to his office. In the office, something unforgettable happened. The teacher wanted me to apologize to the students who bullied me. Since then, I don't trust teachers anymore. To me, being a teacher is not a noble profession; they just take money and don't help students.

Now you can understand why I say that people should not be too kind because if you are, others will bully you. If you don't want to be bullied, the only way is to make yourself stronger and learn to be indifferent to everyone. Think of yourself as a devil; if people bully you, you will fight back.

That is me right now.

Becoming Indifferent to Avoid Being Bullied

	I've decided to become an indifferent person so that I won't be bullied anymore. This decision comes from several experiences where my kindness was mistaken for weakness.
	
	When I was twelve, a relative accused me of hitting her daughter. I was confused because I hadn't done anything wrong. Despite my innocence, I was harshly scolded. This taught me that being kind and understanding doesn't always protect you from false accusations and mistreatment.
	
	Another time, while playing basketball, the ball accidentally hit a relative's car. Even though it wasn't my fault, I was the one who get scolded because I was the youngest. This made me realize that being nice often leads to being blamed unfairly.
	
	In high school, teachers always said to report bullying, and they would help. I did this when I was bullied, but instead of support, the teacher asked me to apologize to the bullies. This made me lose faith in authority figures who were supposed to protect us.
	
	These experiences showed me that kindness often results in being taken advantage of or mistreated. So, I've decided to protect myself by becoming indifferent and unfeeling. Now, if someone tries to bully me, I am ready to fight back without hesitation.
	
	In conclusion, becoming indifferent is my way of safeguarding myself. It ensures that I won't be hurt again. While I may not be the same person I once was, I am now stronger and more resilient.

Recently, I noticed a lot of oil on my face, so I decided to clean it. I bought a facial cleanser on the Lazada app. When I received the facial cleanser, I started using it 4 or 5 times a day to make sure there was no oil left on my face.

So far, I have found this facial cleanser to be very effective for me, so I bought two more on Lazada.

My face tends to get oily easily, so I use the facial cleanser every time I shower. I really love this facial cleanser. Facial cleansers are not only for women; men can use them too, because it is estimated that men's faces produce more oil than women's.

Keeping your face clean will help you become more handsome and beautiful. If you want to be a handsome boy, you must listen to me: use a facial cleanser and wash your face with it every day.

Recently, I read a Japanese novel called "Rashomon." This book explores the darkness of human nature. I really enjoy stories and movies with similar themes, but this is my first time reading a novel about the darkness of humanity.

The first story is about a warrior who has no money or food. He hasn't eaten anything for several days. Then he comes to an abandoned house, after hesitating for a while, decides to go inside.

He hears a faint noise upstairs, so he slowly goes up and sees an old woman cutting the hair off a dead body. At this moment, the warrior becomes very angry and scolds the old woman.

The woman tries to run away, but the warrior pulls out his knife and holds it to her neck. They exchange some words, and then the warrior strips the old woman of all her clothes and leaves.

This story illustrates that if you can seize someone else's belongings, others can also seize yours. Personally, I think this novel's portrayal of the darkness in human nature is very well written.

Playing Basketball

Basketball is one of my favourite sports. I enjoy playing it because it not only keeps me fit but also helps me develop teamwork and coordination skills. Envery weekend, I go to the local basketball court with my friends to play a few games.

When I play basketball, I feel a sense of excitement and energy. The fast pace of the game and the need for quick decisions keep me engaged and focused. I love the feeling of scoring a basket and hearing the cheers from my teammates. It;s a sport that requires both physical and mental strength.

Playing  basketball has also taught me the importance of teamwork. A successful game relies on good communication and cooperation among team menbers. Passing the ball, setting up plays, and supporting each other are crucial element of the game. Through basketball, I have learned to trust my teammates and work together towards a common goal.

Moreover, basketball is a great way to relieve stress. After a long week of studying, playing basketball helps me relax and clear my mind. The physical activity releases endorphins, which improve my mood and reduce anxiety. It's a heathly and fun way to unwind and stay active.

In conclusion, basketball is more than just a sport to me. It's a source of joy, a way to stay fit, and a means to develop important life skills. I look forward to playing basketball every weekend, and I hope to continue enjoying this wonderful sport for many years to come.

I was born into a family full of arguments and quarrels. I have never seen my parents communicate happily. They always argue, and I am fed up with it.

I really hope my family will be happy and communicate well, without any arguments or fights. But my grandmother enjoys watching others scold my mother, which is why I dislike her. No child likes seeing their mother being scolded.

I have heard my grandmother say many bad things about my mother before. For instance, she would say, "Your mother only cares about herself, she is very lazy, likes to go out with friends, and doesn't work but just wastes money."

My father also scolds my mother very often. That is why I want to leave this home because it is not a happy place for me when I hear them argue.

No child likes living in a home full of arguments and fights. I still remember wanting to leave this home and live somewhere else once, not because I wanted to live alone, but because I couldn't bear my parents always arguing. I had enough of it all.

In China, students have to study all the time, they need to take all kind of impontant exams, their parents want their kids take the first place, so students bury their heads in the book. When taking abount Chinese kids and foreign kids, it has been admitted that Chinese kids are good at exam, while foreign kids are good at hand work, I think hand work is more important than the exam, students need to do some work to make themselves living. Chinese students need to join more activities, it can not only help them broaden their vision, but also can improve their overall quality. Besides getting high scores, students also need to learn to do some hand work, or they will become bookworms. Parents should not care so much about the exams, they should give the children more freedom, exam is not everything.

It has been estimated that smokers have made up half of the population in China. And the smokers are becoming younger and younger, even including some middle school students.

Nowadays more and more people have realized smoking can do harm to people's health. However, some people still enjoy smoking. Why? Because some of the them think it is a kind of fashion, some think it is of great fun and others, think that smoking can refresh themselves.

In fact, smoking is a bad habit. It can cause a lot of disease. Meanwhile smoking is a waste of money. Besides, careless smojers may cause dangerous fires.

Smoking is harmful and it it not only bad for smokers themselves, but also bad for non-smokers.

Therefore, I hope all the smokers can give up smoking for themselves and aloso for the people around them.

I'm writing to tell you about a recent discussion our class have had on whether or not university students should be financially independent.

60% of the students think that university students dont't have to be financially independent, because tring to make money will affect their studies. They also think that they can repay their parent in the future.

25% of my classmates hold the view that doing part-time jobs will heklp one gain work experince and learn more of society. Besides, when students find it hard to make money, the won;t waste their money any longer

15% of the students, including myself, partly agree with the opinions above. Personally I think as grownups, wwe should not depent on our parents any more. However, if our parents can afford to pay the tuition for us, we should put our studies in the first place. Thank you for reading my letter your.
